COCOSegmentationToBBoxConverter - Converts COCO Segmentations to Bounding Box Format for CVAT Compatibility

Author: Yael Vicente  
Date: April 3, 2025  
Version: 1.0

Description:
    This class provides functionality to process and clean COCO annotation files by removing 
    polygon segmentations and leaving only bounding boxes (bbox). This transformation is required 
    for compatibility with CVAT when importing annotations as pure bounding boxes.

    Features:
        - Validates essential COCO structure.
        - Sets "segmentation": [] for all annotations.
        - Filters invalid bbox entries.
        - Saves the cleaned file in standard COCO format (JSON).
